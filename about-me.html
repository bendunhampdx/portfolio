              Hello there! My name is Ben Dunham. I grew up in a small town in Ohio and made my way out to Portland, Oregon in 2010. It was my goal to be the first in my family to graduate from college and I set out to do just that at Portland State University. I began my schooling as a Philosophy major and spent five years questioning my very existence. That is, until I found myself in a Feminist Philosophy course that expanded my world view and shifted my major to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. Upon graduating with my Bachelors degree I did what any self-respecting graduate does and began bartending full time. Which leads me to the here and now. I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp so that I can begin a new career as a Developer. I absolutely love spending time problem solving in front of my iMac. It would be a dream to break into this field and help to change tech culture to be more diverse and inclusive.
